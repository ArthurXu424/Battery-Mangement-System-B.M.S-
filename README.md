# Battery-Mangement-System-B.M.S-
This is BMS for Li based batteries. Top level balancing of cells are used. Can be used in Vehicles and small scale applications. I designed this system for 16S2P you can use upto 48 cells with slight modification. I used Samsung 18650 26J cells I designed the PCB according to this dimension , you can modiffy for other cell sizes.
Features of the systems are 
1. Alarms when battery reches max or min threshold voltages.
2. alarms when Battery package voltage exceeds set limit.
3. ALarms when a current reaches maximum set limit value.
4. Monitors voltage of each cell.
5. Data acn be looged to pc.
6. Cell upto 48 can be used.
7. Cell Temperature (max & min, with high alarm)
8. Fault Code Tracking (keeps a record of the past 5 faults)
9. Charger Control (0-5V to suit TC Charger and others)

Parts used :
1.LM78LXX Series 3-Terminal Voltage Regulators
2.PIC16F1827 and the PIC12F1822 Microcontrollers.
